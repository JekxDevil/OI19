Use an IDE because emacs is quite confusing.

Set numbered lines because when moving around the program,
it's likely students can't follow the flow.

When running programs, keep the most significant parts of code open,
in this case an IDE could perfectly address the issue, 
so the code and terminal can be shown simultaneously.

Use common code style, give hints about formatters and linters.

Avoid having emacs info at the bottom bar always changing because it's "noise".

Valgrind is wonderful to spot errors of memory leakeage, 
but it urgent to encourage usage of breakpoints in an IDE to have step-by-step 
overview of all the variables changing in memory in real time.

The IDE suggested would be Clion from Jetbrains IDEs family,
since Visual Studio 2022 isn't available for GNU/Linux machines.

The purpose is to program effectively, everything that ease our 
understanding is incouraged, hence powerful tools to have a clear
view of what's going on during runtime under the hood.

The fewer the moments experienced trying to figuring out what's wrong on our code 
after a mysterious crash we don't really grasp,
the better.
